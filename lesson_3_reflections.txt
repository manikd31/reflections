When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	This might be essential in cases when you don't have your local desktop or PC with you with all of your local commits. So having a remote set up on GitHub might help in such cases, where you can pull recent updates on your local PCs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I think it's  better to pull changes manually so you know which update does what. Having Git automatically updating the local repository will create confusion relating to the commits. IDK what should be the better reason.
